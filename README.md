# Simple-Java-Proxy-Interceptor

Very simple and minimal java proxy interceptor that I wrote to practice socket comms and learn HTTP structure. Doesn't work on HTTPS obviously.

# Usage

Compile the project and run. Enter the port number that you want the proxy to work on. Click manually intercept. Then you will be able to intercept incoming requests to your proxy.

# Features

Add header and value, remove header, edit header and value

#TODO

*Automated task using JSON input - will do when I have some spare time on my hands.
*Clean the code, add comment lines.
